- Chapter 1 - [The Body](https://github.com/calebwin/emu/blob/master/book/body.md#the-emu-book)

If you want to get up and running as fast as possible, I would recommend starting in chapter 0 and then skipping over to chapter 5. The examples provided in the [`/examples`](https://github.com/calebwin/emu/edit/master/examples) directory can be helpful.
