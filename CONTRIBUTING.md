# Contributing
You are likely looking at this page because you are interested in contributing to the Emu project. That's great! The Emu project has one main goal: to make programming GPUs simpler. We are currently focusing on doing this through the Rust language and by mainly by defining useful procedural macros.
The best way to contribute, is to click over to the Issues tab. The Issues tab is where we discuss things to add, delete, or change in the project. You can contribute by doing one of 3 things-
- Creating issues; issues can be created to spark direction about a new change that could be made among other things
- Discussing issues; discussion can help the community progress towards a final decision regarding the change
- Making PRs; making PRs is part of the discussion - it helps people see how we can actually change the way Emu works and ultimately its how we implement a change (if you don't know what it means to make a PR to a repository, go [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project))
